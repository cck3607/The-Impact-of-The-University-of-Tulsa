## Why Play Sports In College?

Playing college football as a walk-on at the University of Tulsa was one of the main
reasons I choose to come to the University. Personally, coming out of high school I
wanted to go to a college that I could get the best education and play football at. My
experience playing football helped me grow a lot as a student. While playing football at
tulsa I met some of my closest and lifelong friends that I could not imagine going through
college without. The memories and bond we made working through the summer when no
one was on campus, is one of my favorite memories from college. Coming in as a walk-
on was terrifying. At first I worried that I would be treated different or feel that I didn’t
belong with scholarship players. Though I never experienced or saw any of that.
Everyone treated everyone the same and gave them respect because we all put in the
same amount of work everyday. One of the many lessons I learned from playing football
at Tulsa was time management. Often times you have to wake up early and get home
late as a player. This taught me the importance of time management. Whenever I had a
half hour between meetings or class I had to take advantage of that time to get my school
work done. Doing this would sometimes give you the ability to go to sleep when you got
home instead of having to stay up another hour or two to finish work. This has helped me
tremendously in college and is something I will continue to do for the rest of my life.

### Finding A Major That Interest You

Coming into college I really had no idea what I wanted to study. I ended up choosing
business marketing because my Dad is in marketing. Though I always had an interest in
technology and had a Brother who was a cybersecurity engineer. After stepping away
from football I had discussed switching my major with my family and professor. It seemed
like the perfect opportunity because I would still graduate on time and the courses I had
taken freshman year would cont towards my new major. At the beginning of sophomore
year I switched my major to Computer Information Systems and my minor to
Cybersecurity. I was incredibly scared at first because I felt intimidated by coding. With
training, it became one of my greatest strengths and I now find it easy to do. In addition, I
took up a large interest in cybersecurity. The University of Tulsa has one of the best
cybersecurity programs in the country. I became involved in numerous cyber clubs and
learned a great amount. Each cyber meeting would consist of either having a cyber
security professional speak or allowing participants to do hands on labs working through
them together. It was a great opportunity that allowed students to take as much as they
wanted away from it. I became so interested in cyber security that I obtained an internship
in cyber security and made it my main career focus. Initially, I was so intimidated to switch
my major that I was pursuing a career I was not interested in, but with the help of my
family and my professors who encouraged me to do so it has been one of the best
experiences of my life. I would suggest to anyone who is thinking about doing the same to
take that leap. If you decide to take the leap such as I did, it will pay off especially if is
something you’re passionate about.

### Finding A Mentor

The professors at the University of Tulsa are top of the class. As a student you have the
ability to build relationships with all of your professors in a small class setting. During this
time, I have had the privilege of being taught by a professor who knew my brother and
who later would become a great influence in my decision to switch my major and minor to
cybersecurity. He met with me one on one as I discussed my hesitation to switch and my
intimidation of coding. He ensured me that I would be successful in all of my future
courses with my new major and that I had nothing to worry about. Not only was he right,
but those were actually some of my favorite classes I took because coding gives you the
ability to build so many different things in so many different ways. My one on one
meetings with my professor when I found myself struggling with a topic played a large
role in my success in the major. I have since realized during my time at the University of
Tulsa, that students have the ability to have this experience with every professor ensuring
success for all. Had it not been for my mentor, I am unsure about where or what I would
be studying today.
I would recommend to every student to utilize the resources the University has offered
them by seeking a mentor. By doing so students will receive key career advice in many
different areas including course advisement, connection opportunities with employers,
and exploration of major options.
